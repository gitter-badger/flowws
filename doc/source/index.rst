Welcome to flowws's documentation!
==================================

`flowws <https://github.com/klarh/flowws>`_ is an in-development
framework for building modular, reusable task workflows. The core
library contains tools to abstract over storage locations and parse
arguments in a uniform way for both python scripts and
command-line-based execution.

`flowws` is being developed in conjunction with `hoomd-flowws
<https://github.com/klarh/hoomd-flowws>`_, which implements a set of
flowws modules for use with `hoomd-blue
<https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue>`_.
