Welcome to flowws's documentation!
==================================

`flowws` is an in-development framework for building modular, reusable
task workflows. The core library contains tools to abstract over
storage locations and parse arguments in a uniform way for both python
scripts and command-line-based execution.

`flowws` is being developed in conjunction with `hoomd-flowws
<https://github.com/klarh/hoomd-flowws>`_, which implements a set of
flowws modules for use with `hoomd-blue
<https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue>`_.
